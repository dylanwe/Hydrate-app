# 🙋‍♂️ Hydrate IOS app
Hydrate is a small IOS app that helps you track your daily water intake. You can change how much you want to drink and how much millileter a glass contains.

## 👨‍💻 How I made it
After having made a site with React I stumbled on a React-Native tutorial that explaind how to make an app. It seemed similiar enough so I though why not try it. The skills that I learned in my last React project came in handy as the skills translate really well.
  
## 👨‍🏫 What I learned
- [x] A chuck of React-native
- [x] Making an app
- [x] A bit about state management
  
## 📌 What I would do differently
- Connect it to a database so that I can store a lot of data and use that in the program. For instance a page with tiles like Github showing how much water you where drinking each day.
- Store day streaks of hitting your goals.
